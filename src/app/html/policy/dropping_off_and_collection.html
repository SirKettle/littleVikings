<h3>Dropping Off</h3>
<p>Please let me know in advance if you intend to arrive at a different time from the contracted one. If you arrive unexpectedly early I may not be ready to care for your child. Please discuss with me if you need to change your contracted hours.</p>

<h3>Collection</h3>
<p>I will only release your child from my care to adults who have permission to collect him/her. I will therefore need you to provide me with a list of people authorised to collect.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the event of an emergency, we can operate a password system where you can send someone not authorised to collect your child but who is able to give the password. Please discuss with me how you would like to use this system.</p>

<p>It is important that you arrive at the contracted time to collect your child. I know sometimes delays are unavoidable, especially if you are relying on public transport. If you are delayed, for whatever reason please contact me and let me know when you expect to arrive. I will normally be able to accommodate the additional care, however if I am unable, I will contact other adults from the authorised list and arrange for them to collect your child. I will reassure your child that you are on the way and if necessary organise additional activities and a meal.</p>
<p>If I have not heard from you and you are very late I will try and make contact with you. I will also attempt to contact the emergency numbers provided. If I am unable to make contact with anyone I will inform Social Services and follow their advice.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to make an additional charge for late collection.</p>
