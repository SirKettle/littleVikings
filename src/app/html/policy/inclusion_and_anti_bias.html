<p>I give all children in my care the opportunity to reach their full potential. Sometimes this means adapting an activity to the child’s ability and stage of development, providing additional resources or giving one child more attention and support than others during a particular activity or routine.</p>

<p>All children in my care are given the opportunity to play with all the toys (subject to health and safety with children under 3 years of age). No toys are just for girls or just for boys. I try to ensure my toys reflect positive images of children and people from different cultures and with different abilities.</p>

<p>No child in my care will be discriminated against in anyway, whether for their skin colour, culture, gender, ability or religion. I will challenge any remarks that I feel are inappropriate.</p>

<p>I encourage the children in my care to learn more about their own culture and to find out about the culture and religions of other children. We do in this in a fun way through sharing books, cooking and eating food from around the world.</p>

<p>I encourage the children to develop a healthy respect of each other’s differences and to value everyone as an individual.</p>

<p>I encourage Parents to share with us any festivals, special occasions or artefacts, which may enhance the children’s learning and understanding.</p>
