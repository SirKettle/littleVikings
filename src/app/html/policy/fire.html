<h3>It is my absolute priority to get all babies and children to safety in the case of a fire, while they are in my care as quickly and as safely as possible.</h3>

<p>I have in place two smoke detectors, one in the kitchen and one in the hallway, which I check regularly.</p>

<p>In the kitchen above the hob I have in place at all times a fire blanket, which would be replaced if ever used.</p>

<p>Behind the kitchen door I have a small fire extinguisher which I will only use in an emergency.</p>

<h3>If there is a fire:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>First I will get the babies and children to a place of safety as quickly and safely as possible.</li>
	<li>I will have a meeting point outside of the concierge desk of New river village.</li>
	<li>I will ring 999 for the fire brigade.</li>
	<li>I will reassure all babies and children in my care.</li>
	<li>Ring and inform all parents.</li>
</ul>
