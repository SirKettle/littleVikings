<p>The safety of your child is paramount and I will take every measure I can to protect your children from hurting themselves. However, sometimes accidents do happen. I have written the following procedure on how I will deal with such a situation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I will ensure everyone is safe</li>
	<li>I will comfort the child and reassure them.</li>
	<li>I will assess the extent of their injuries and if necessary call for medical support/ambulance.</li>
	<li>I will administer first aid where necessary. I have been trained to carry out to these procedures and have the required certificate.</li>
	<li>I will call upon back up support by another registered childminder or known responsible adult to care for other children within my care, and where this is not possible I will take all the children with me or send the child alone with the ambulance team who will be safely trained and competent to care or the child.</li>
	<li>Once the child is more settled I will contact you as soon as possible to inform you of the accident, and if necessary I will ask you to return to care for your child / meet me at the hospital.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After every accident, however minor I will:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Complete a report in my accident book.</li>
	<li>Ask you to sign the report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If the incident requires any medical treatment then I will:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Inform Ofsted</li>
	<li>Inform my Insurance Company.</li>
	<li>Contact the NCMA for additional advice/support.</li>
	<li>Carry out a risk assessment to see if the accident is preventable in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you keep me informed regarding your childâ€™s condition following an accident and if you have sought medical advice.</p>
