<h3>Any information regarding your child or your family, given to me either verbally or in writing, will be treated as confidential.</h3>

<p>Parents will have access to their own child’s records but not to others. All documentation relating to your child is stored in a file, which is not accessible to any other party.</p>

<p>I will not discuss your child with others unless I have permission from you, for example to take your baby to be weighed by the Health Visitor. I will however, divulge confidential information to Social Services and to Ofsted if I have any concerns that your child is being abused. Please see my Child Protection Policy.</p>

<p>You will also find out confidential information about my family and I during the course of our working relationship, and I would be grateful if you too would respect my family’s confidentiality and not repeat what you may have been told to other parties.</p>
