<h3>The Health and Safety of your child is very important to me and I have therefore documented the following procedures that I have in place to support this.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All toys will be checked and cleaned regularly to ensure they are safe for your child to use. Any broken or hazardous toys will be removed immediately. Children will only be offered toys and resources that are suitable for their age/stage of development</li>
	<li>I do a risk assessment of my home every morning before the children arrive to ensure that it is a safe environment for minded children.</li>
	<li>All plug sockets not in use have socket covers.</li>
	<li>All equipment will be checked and cleaned regularly. All equipment is fitted with the correct safety harnesses to prevent accidents, for example highchair and pushchairs.</li>
	<li>I use safety equipment appropriate for the children in my care, eg. cupboard locks etc. These are checked regularly.</li>
	<li>I will keep my front door locked to prevent the children opening the door to strangers.</li>
	<li>I have procedures in place in the event of a fire (see separate policy)</li>
	<li>I keep my kitchen very clean, following hygiene guidelines on the storing of food, keeping the fridge at the correct temperature etc</li>
	<li>I ensure that the children do not have access to any waste. I do not permit smoking in my home.</li>
	<li>I follow strict hygiene guidelines to prevent cross contamination.</li>
	<li>The bathroom will be kept clean and all hazardous materials kept out of reach of the children. Children will wash their hands before all snacks and meals.</li>
	<li>I have strict Child protection guidelines in place (see separate policy)</li>
	<li>Children must stay with me when we are away from the home. Younger children will be strapped in a pushchair; older children will either be on a harness or wrist strap, or holding onto my hand/pushchair.</li>
	<li>I have emergency contact details with me at all times should I need to contact the parents / guardian.</li>
	<li>I will work with you to teach the children about safety issues like crossing the road and stranger danger.</li>
	<li>I will work with you to teach the children about making healthy food choices and physical exercise.</li>
