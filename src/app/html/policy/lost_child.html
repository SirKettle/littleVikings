<h3>The care of your child is of up most importance and I will always strive to ensure that they remain with me and are safe.</h3>
<p>However sometimes children can become ‘lost’ in busy places and therefore as a responsible childminder I have written a procedure that will be followed in the unlikely event of this happening.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I will immediately raise the alarm to all around me that I have lost a child and enlist the help of everyone to look for them.</li>
	<li>If it is a secure area such as a shopping centre, I will quickly alert the security staff so they can seal off exits and monitor the situation on any CCTV.</li>
	<li>I will provide everyone involved in the search with a description of the child.</li>
	<li>I will reassure the other children with me, as they may be distressed.</li>
	<li>I will then alert the police and provide a full description using a photo taken at the settling in session.</li>
	<li>I will then alert the parents of the situation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I take precautions to avoid situations like this happening by implementing the following measures:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Ensuring the children hold my hand / pushchair or wear a harness whilst we are out</li>
	<li>Avoid going to places that are overcrowded.</li>
	<li>I teach the children about the dangers of wandering off and of talking to strangers.</li>
	<li>I teach what the children what to do and where / who to go to if separated.</li>
</ul>
