<h3>A good balanced diet is vital for children to develop healthily along with fresh air and regular exercise.</h3>

<p>I am happy to provide all children in my care with healthy meals, snacks and drinks, or to cook/serve food provided by their parents.</p>

<p>I encourage children to choose healthy options and to experiment by trying new foods from other cultures. Older children are encouraged to help in the preparation of food and meals. I am happy to discuss menus with parents and cater for children with different food allergies and cultural/religious requirements. If your child has any particular dislikes or favourite dishes please let me know.</p>

<p>I will record what your child has eaten and approximate amounts in the daily contact book. If you have any concerns regarding diet/menu/quantity please do not hesitate to discuss it with me.</p>

<p>I am happy to support you if you are weaning your baby. I have a blender and am willing to make pureed dishes if required.  I am comfortable following a <strong>baby-led</strong> approach too.</p>

<p>I do not permit children to have fizzy drinks.  Children are offered water, milk or fruit juices.</p>

<p>I do not encourage children to eat sweets on a regular basis, however I do sometimes offer sweets for special occasions. Please let me know what, if any sweets you permit your child to eat.</p>
