<p>I own a 2 year old cocker spaniel named Hattie</p>
<p>I believe that children can learn a lot from having contact with animals, however certain procedures must be followed to ensure the safety of the children:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Children must be encouraged to treat all animals with respect, learning how to handle them correctly.</li>
	<li>Children must wash their hands after any contact with animals and understand the reasoning behind this.</li>
	<li>Children must be taught that not all animals are child friendly and that they should always check with the animal’s owner before attempting to stroke or handle them.</li>
	<li>Food for the pet must be stored safely away from the children’s reach</li>
	<li>A high standard of hygiene must be followed, with careful thought given to the placing of the feeding and drink bowls.  Hattie is regularly bathed and brushed.</li>
	<li>The garden must be checked every morning, before the children are permitted outside to play, to ensure that no animal has fouled it.</li>
</ul>
