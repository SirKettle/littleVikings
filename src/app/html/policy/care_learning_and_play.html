<p>Children learn when they are in a safe and caring environment where they are stimulated through play.</p>
<p>Babies and young children develop best when they are in a caring relationship with an adult. A baby will learn to walk faster when they have a safe pair of arms to walk towards and learn to talk, when they have an adult listening and responding to them.</p>
<p>I will strive to provide your child with an environment that will be caring, fun and stimulating. I will follow the Early Years Foundation Stage guidelines when providing care for your child.</p>
<p>(Please ask me if you would like to see a copy of these documents)
