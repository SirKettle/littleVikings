<p>I know that as a working parent, you require a childminder who is reliable. I will endeavor to work on all the days that I am contracted to. I am happy to work when I have minor ailments such as colds etc., however I will not work if I have sickness or diarrhea or any other highly contagious infection. Continuing to work would only result in a further spreading of the germs and I would be unable to give your child the care they deserve.</p>

<p>I have therefore arranged emergency cover with the following Ofsted Registered Childminders:</p>

<br>
<p><em>(Please contact me for details)</em></p>
<br>


<p>They are all known to your child and are happy to care for him/her whilst I am unwell, providing it doesnâ€™t take them over their registered numbers. If you wish to meet with them beforehand please let me know. If I contact you to inform you that I am unwell and therefore unable to work please call one of the childminders to arrange cover. I do not charge if I am unable to work through illness and the above-mentioned childminders will charge you at our agreed rate for the day(s) they cover.</p>
