<p>When taking Children on Outings it is essential that proper planning is done to ensure the safety and welfare of all children involved.</p>
<p>I obtain written parental permission for all routine and special outings. I inform parents of any planned special trips for example to the zoo or a local farm.</p>
<p>I ensure that I take with me everything I may need, emergency Contact numbers for the children, First Aid Kit, Nappies and changing bag (if required) spare clothes, mobile phone, drinks and a healthy snack.</p>

<p>I have developed plans on what to do in the event of an emergency. I carry the childâ€™s daily diary with emergency contact numbers and any other relevant information.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to organise outings to fit the needs of the children, and ensure that I have the necessary equipment and resources to keep them safe. These include pushchairs and harnesses.</p>
<p>I will never leave your child unattended when out.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns regarding this policy please discuss them with me.</p>
