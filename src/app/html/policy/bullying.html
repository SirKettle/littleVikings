<p>I will not permit any form of bullying in my home</p>

<h3>Bullying can be:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Physical: pushing, kicking, hitting, biting etc</li>
	<li>Verbal: Name-calling, sarcasm, rumour spreading and teasing</li>
	<li>Emotional: Excluding, ridicule, humiliation, tormenting</li>
	<li>Racist: taunts, graffiti and gestures</li>
</ul>

<p>Being bullied can result in the victim having depression, low self-esteem, shyness, poor academic achievement, isolation and in extreme cases threatened or attempted suicide.</p>
<p>If a bully is left unchecked they will learn they can get away with violence and aggression. A bully has a higher chance of acquiring a criminal record and not being able to have good relationships when they become an adult.</p>
<p>If I have any concerns that a child in my care is being bullied at (pre-) school or is bullying, I will discuss the matter with you immediately. I will work with you to support your child to resolve the problem.</p>

<h3>If your child is being bullied:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I will reassure them that the bullying is not their fault</li>
	<li>Tell them that I care about them and am 100% on their side</li>
	<li>I will give them lots of praise, encouragement and responsibilities to help them feel valued</li>
	<li>I will work with you to help the child to develop techniques to deal with the bully- assertiveness, walking away etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your child is the bully:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I will reassure your child that I still care about them but it is their behaviour I donâ€™t like and I will work with them to help change this</li>
	<li>I will work with your child to find ways to make amends for their actions</li>
	<li>I will develop a reward structure for good behaviour</li>
	<li>I will discuss the matter with you, not in front of your child, to see if there are any problems that may have triggered the bullying.</li>
	<li>If you have any concerns regarding your child please discuss them with me as soon as possible. It is much better to deal with these problems before they become major issues.</li>
</ul>
