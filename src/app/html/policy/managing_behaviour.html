<h3>Promoting positive behaviour is very important and I do this by:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Giving lots of praise for good behaviour</li>
	<li>Giving the children individual attention so they feel valued</li>
	<li>Setting a good example, being a good role model</li>
	<li>Listening to what the children have to say</li>
	<li>Rewarding good behaviour (choosing next activity etc)</li>
	<li>Giving children stickers for good behaviour, sharing etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I help the children understand my house rules, which are realistic and I am consistent in the enforcing of them. I do not give out confusing signals, Saying No means No!</p>

<p>I am aware of the different reasons why children misbehave and will endeavour to keep to routines so that your child feels safe and is not over tired or hungry.</p>

<p>However all children will misbehave at sometime. I have developed several different strategies on how to deal with a child misbehaving and use different ones depending on the age/stage of ability of the child and the situation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Distraction. Remove the child from the situation and give them an alternative activity.</li>
	<li>Ignore. Depending on the situation I may ignore the bad behaviour as I feel it is being done to provoke a reaction.</li>
	<li>Discuss with Child. If the child is able to understand I will discuss their behaviour and try and get them to appreciate the consequences of their actions on others. I inform them that it is their behaviour I do not like, not them.</li>
	<li>Time Out. Removing the child from the activity and sitting them quietly for a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I will never smack, shake or hurt your child. I will not humiliate your child.</h3>

<p>If a child misbehaves I will let you know by either writing it in their contact book or by ringing you later after collection. Some children can become upset if the incident is retold in front of them. I will also inform you of how the matter was dealt with.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns regarding the managing of your childâ€™s behaviour, please do not hesitate to contact me. It is important that we work together on managing behaviour in order not to confuse your child.</p>
