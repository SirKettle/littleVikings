<h3>I, and my husband, are non-smokers.</h3>

<p>No one (including parents) is permitted to smoke inside the premises or in the outside areas such as the garden and front garden, which surround the premises.</p>

<p>A no smoking policy will be promoted and children will be educated that it is unhealthy.</p>
