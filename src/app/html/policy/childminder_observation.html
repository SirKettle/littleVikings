<h3>The Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum states:</h3>
<h4>&quot;All planning starts with observing children in order to understand and consider their current interests, development and learning.&quot;</h4>

<h3>I implement the EYFS by:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Making systematic observations and assessment of each child’s achievements, interests and learning styles</li>
	<li>Use these observations and assessments to identify learning priorities and plan relevant and motivating learning experiences for each child</li>
	<li>Match their observations to the expectations of the early learning goals. Depending on the age of your child I will be using the EYFS to support my work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will make regular observations on your child, using different mediums, for example, their daily diary, photograph’s, written observations or video recordings. You are welcome to see copies of any of my observations. All observations are only made for personal use and will remain confidential.
I request each parent to sign a form giving me permission to carry out and record observations on their child.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns regarding the content of this policy please do discuss them with me.</p>
