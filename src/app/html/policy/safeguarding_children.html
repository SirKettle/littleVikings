<h3>Policy statement:</h3>

<p>I, Anna-Victoria Thirkettle, am responsible for the children within my care.  My priority is their wellbeing and if I have concerns about a child’s welfare I will report them to the relevant parties following the <strong>Haringey Safeguarding Children Board</strong> procedures.  These procedures are available through the website <a href="http://www.haringeylscb.org">www.haringeylscb.org</a></p>
<p>Any significant changes in a child’s behavior, unexpected bruising or marks, or possible signs of abuse, any comments made which give me cause for concern, any deterioration in general wellbeing which causes concern, and any signs of neglect will be acknowledged, recorded and reported.</p>

<h3>Procedures:</h3>

<p>I keep a record of names, addresses and contact details of all parents, guardians and Carers of the children under my care. </p>

<p>I keep up to date with my food hygiene certificate, first aid certificate, and any relevant legislation and child protection issues by taking regular training courses and reading relevant literature.</p>

<p>Each child has a personal record including Medical issues, Allergies, and developmental assessment.</p>

<p>Children will only be released to the registered parent/carer, unless I have a signed, written notification that another individual will be collecting the child.  No children will leave unsupervised.</p>

<p>All accidents, incidents or injuries are recorded within the accident book along with name, time and date.</p>

<p>All medicines are kept out of reach of the children.</p>

<p>A record is kept in the child’s personal file of any medicine administered, including name, date, time and reason for administering.</p>

<p>Parents must notify me of any concerns they have about the child so we can work together to have a consistent approach.</p>

<p>My husband, William Thirkettle, and I must keep a current DBS check.  We are mindful of how we dress, talk and behave around the children.
Within the hours of childcare our home will be treated as a place of business.</p>

<p>Regular risk assessments are carried out to ensure the premises, garden, and any outings, provide a safe environment for the ages and stages of the children in my care.</p>
<p>The children are introduced to ‘Road safety’, ‘House rules’, ‘Boundaries’, and ‘Personal space’, and through play we explore what is acceptable and unacceptable.</p>

<p>If a child confides in me I listen and take the matter seriously.  Confidentiality will be assured when it is clear that there is no risk of harm to the child.</p>

<p>I am aware of the possible signs of abuse and will implement the local Safeguarding Childrens Board procedures with immediate effect, keeping a factual record of the concern including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The childs full name and address</li>
	<li>The date and time of the record</li>
	<li>Factual details of the concern</li>
	<li>Details of any previous concerns</li>
	<li>Details of any explanations from the parents</li>
	<li>Any action taken</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not my responsibility to investigate these matters and I shall pass the information I have to the appropriate person.</p>

<p>If I am suspected of causing harm or abuse I will notify the Haringey LSCB and follow the procedures laid out.</p>
