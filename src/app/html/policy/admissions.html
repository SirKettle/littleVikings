<p>As an Ofsted registered Childminder I am restricted to the number and ages of children that I can care for at any one time. These details are on my Ofsted Registration Certificate, which is displayed during my minding hours.</p>
<p>I am registered to care for __ children.</p>
<p>I am happy to take of any baby/child within my registered numbers and will not discriminate against children or their families for reasons such as race, religion, sex or ability.</p>
<p>I am happy to take on children with special needs providing I feel I can provide them with the care they need. (For example I will not be able to provide one to one care or look after a child in a wheelchair, as my home is not suitable) If your child has additional needs please discuss them with me first as I would not want to raise your expectations.</p>
<p>All children will be welcomed into my home and I will encourage the other children in my care to support me with this. I will request a four-week settling in period on our contract, so if you or your child or I am not happy with the arrangement it can be terminated easily. When taking on additional children I must take into consideration the children already in my care who are happy and settled. It would be very unfair on them to introduce a child who was disruptive.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns regarding my admissions policy please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
